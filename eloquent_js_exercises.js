with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" 
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" 
for numbers divisible by only one of those). */

/* Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid 
there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 
and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the 
given width and height.
